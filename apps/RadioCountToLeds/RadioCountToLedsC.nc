/**
 * Implementation of the RadioCountToLeds application. RadioCountToLeds 
 * maintains a 4Hz counter, broadcasting its value in an AM packet 
 * every time it gets updated. A RadioCountToLeds node that hears a counter 
 * displays the bottom three bits on its LEDs. This application is a useful 
 * test to show that basic AM communication and timers work.
