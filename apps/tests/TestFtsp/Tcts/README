Demo Setup:
- we need 4 nodes:
  - 2 nodes need to be programmed with NOCOMP undefined, 2 with defined. The
    2 defined ones will run regular FTSP.
  - node id's should be 6, 7, 8, 9
  - program 9 with NOCOMP

- node 1 is the TCXO root node
- node 4000 is the basestation

- conect serial forwarder to basestation
- run TctsPlotError.py sf@localhost:9002. This should start the wxPython
  plotting window showing current error, temperature index, and frequency
  error.


In the default configuration:
- TS beacons every 100 seconds
- Compensation every 5 second
